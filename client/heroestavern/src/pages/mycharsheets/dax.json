In the Forgotten Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and thus are the most common variety.  Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life.",

Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road or a raft floating downriver.",

    "backstory": "Dax has worked in Luskan where he grew up as an urchin on the street, but has frequently travelled to Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter in his work. He was taken in by Beldin, a scoundrel and bard in Luskan, when he was barely 10 years old as a bit of a spy and secret collector as well as a trainee bard. For over a decade he ran errands for the alcohol-loving swindler, learning the trade of the bard and the power of secrets.

Dax can come across charming and friendly, but underneath, every action is a calculated decision. He loves luxury, and revels in fine wine and fine company, but tries to never keep gold himself. He will take the dues of his work, but spend them immediately and frivolously, preferring to live in the day to day rather than saving for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Dax was approaching adulthood, his mentor Beldin died of the alcohol he so loved, and Dax found himself on his own. As such, he roamed Faerun searching for tales, often travelling with companions who could protect him whilst he discovered stories - He carries Beldin's own lute and uses it as his own. \r\n\r\n\r\nDax once fell in love with a young halfling who came to listen to his music in Luskan, her smile and her attentive eyes capturing his heart, but he never learned her name and is always seeking her.",

A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.  Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions’ words will be well received.  Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.",

                "backstory": "Dax has worked in Luskan where he grew up as an urchin on the street, but has frequently travelled to Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter in his work. He was taken in by Beldin, a scoundrel and bard in Luskan, when he was barely 10 years old as a bit of a spy and secret collector as well as a trainee bard. For over a decade he ran errands for the alcohol-loving swindler, learning the trade of the bard and the power of secrets. Dax has an affinity for music, and will often play when he needs to think, but his real gift is with his mind. Able to persuade all sorts of people to give up the truth with a disarming smile, there's always something going on behind the scenes. \r\n\r\n\r\nHaving grown up a world of spies and bards, Dax is quick with his tongue and quick with his mind, always having a quip for the day. Dax can come across charming and friendly, but underneath, every action is a calculated decision. He loves luxury, and revels in fine wine and fine company, but tries to never keep gold himself. He will take the dues of his work, but spend them immediately and frivolously, preferring to live in the day to day rather than saving for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Dax was approaching adulthood, his mentor Beldin died of the alcohol he so loved, and Dax found himself on his own. As such, he roamed Faerun searching for tales, often travelling with companions who could protect him whilst he discovered stories - He carries Beldin's own lute and uses it as his own. \r\n\r\n\r\nDax once fell in love with a young halfling who came to listen to his music in Luskan, her smile and her attentive eyes capturing his heart, but he never learned her name and is always seeking her.",
